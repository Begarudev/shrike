"""Iteration-level scheduler: continuous batching (Orca, OSDI '22) with a
Sarathi-Serve (OSDI '24) token budget and chunked prefill.

Every step:
  1. RUNNING sequences are served first. Decodes cost 1 budget token;
     partially-prefilled sequences continue with a chunk that fits the
     remaining budget.
  2. Remaining budget admits WAITING sequences (FCFS), chunking their prompts.
  3. If a decode can't get a KV block, the newest running sequence is
     preempted (blocks freed, recomputed later) — discard-and-recompute
     preemption, as in vLLM.

Chunked prefill keeps every step's token count bounded, so a long prompt
can't stall in-flight decodes — this is what tames p99 inter-token latency.
